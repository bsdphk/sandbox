	=== ==========================================================
	 1  Do not add new functionality unless an
	    implementor cannot complete a real application without it.
	=== ==========================================================
         2  It is as important to decide what a system is not as to

	    rather, make the system extensible so that additional needs
	    can be met in an upwardly compatible fashion.
